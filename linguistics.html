                <p>The field is concered with the interpretation and processing of natural language for wide
                    application to a multitude of problems.</p>

                    Computational linguistics relies greatly on cross discipline collaboration between computer
                    scientists and fields such as linguistics, mathematicians, psycholinguists and artificial
                    intelligence researchers, to name a few. This collaboration is essential to be able to
                    transform the vastly complex sphere of natural language processing into actionable progress
                    in
                    the field.

                    Perhaps on of the most prevalent and recognizable forms of computational linguistics is
                    that of
                    machine translation, a widely available technology through sites such as Google Translate.
                    Originally machine translation was rather simple, performing substitutions of words between
                    languages, however given the complexity of syntax rules, and sentence structure between
                    different languages the results are not always reliable. As such interdisciplinary work on
                    the
                    topic quickly began, and the field of computational linguistics was born. Today cutting
                    edge
                    technology includes work in the area of neural networks and deep learning methods, to be
                    able
                    to abstract the syntax evaluation and deliver better translations. Google moved to neural
                    network translation for Google Translate in 2016 (<a href="https://ai.google/research/pubs/pub45610">Google
                        Neural Machine Translation System</a>.)
                </p>

                <p>
                    Other work includes human-to-machine translation, this instead of aiming to generate a
                    target
                    text aims simply to understand the natural language, spoken or written by humans and allow
                    instructions to be interpreted by the computer. Popular examples include: Apple's Siri,
                    Google
                    Assistant, or Amazon's Alexa.
