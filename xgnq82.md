1. Interest of content
	Excellent - Content is intereting to read and it is clear that reasearch has been done into these topics
2. Consistency and quality of visual presentation
	Sound - Main style is consistant, however the font style changes between pages, especially for the main heading which looks different on each page, even though the heading is the same. Also the formatting means the videos are stretched wide on the page and pictures are full size and take up most of the screen, so that could be changed to make them a more normal size. 
3. Quality of written presentation
	Very Good - Written presenation is of a high standard, apart from a couple of spelling mistakes. However the rest is high quality and well thought out.
4. Validity of HTML
	Excellent - HTML is all valid
5. Evidence of collaboration
	Outstanding
	- The Author info was not written by author
	- The contributions are balanced, each member making a good number of commits and having good input into the project.
	- Most of the content was completed well in advance of the dealine, with only a few small changes added in the last 24 hours.
